Kurosai is a BG2EE pnj who, for a lot of gold, can combine three +x items into one +x+1 item. This works for almost all '+x' items, from weapons to armour to jewellery.
He can combine items up to +6 and the price asked is always "+ desired squared times a thousand": for example, to obtain a +4 shield, he asks for three +3 shields and 16,000 gold coins (4²x1000).


He appears in Trademeet after the Daos have left. Later in the game he will move to Saradush, and disappear with the destruction of the town.


There are some items that kurosai doesn't include in its possibilities because there are so few instances of them in the game that you'll never be able to accumulate enough: wakizashi, ninjatõ, hide armour, splint mail.


Formulas can include objects that are "simply + but with a unique name". These objects are :

There are three optional components to install:
- Kuroisai also appears in Amkethran:
Kuroisai manages to escape Saradush and reappears in Amkethran. This makes it REALLY easy to acquire certain +6 items.
- Recipes cost less but require rare gems:
recipes now only cost double the desired + x 1000 (6000 pos for a +3) but require a gem:
an emerald for +2, a diamond for +3, a star sapphire for +4, a king's tear for +5 and a rogue stone for +6.
- One copy of each +1 item in containers and shops:
Every combinable item has a +1 copy placed somewhere in the game (not on monsters). Yes, those in containers are free.


This module includes Rogue Rebalancing items, and a personal note: composite shortbows are a real cheat, and Rogue Rebalancing offers enough to make at least one +5 composite shortbow.
