Kurosai is a BG2EE npc who, for a lot of gp, can combine three +x items into one +x+1 item. This works for almost all '+x' items, from weapons to armour to jewellery. It can also combine bracers of Defense.
He can combine items up to +6 (AC 0 for the bracers of Defense) and the price asked is always "+ desired squared times a thousand": for example, to obtain a +4 shield, he asks for three +3 shields and 16,000 gp (4²x1000).(2K gp for bracers of Defense AC 7/6/5, then 4K, 9K, etc....)
He appears in Trademeet after the Daos have left. Later in the game he will move to Saradush, and disappear with the destruction of the town.


There are some items that kurosai doesn't include in its possibilities because there are so few instances of them in the game that you'll never be able to accumulate enough: wakizashi, ninjatõ, hide armour, splint mail.


Formulas can include objects that are "simply + but with a unique name". These objects are :
Dagger of <CHARNAME> (+1)			(Dagger)
Heart of the Golem +2				(Dagger)
Ixil's Spike (+2)					(Dagger)
Boneblade +4						(Dagger)
The Shadow's Blade +3				(Short Sword)
Cutthroat +4						(Short Sword)
Rashad's Talon +2					(Scimitar)
Water's Edge +3						(Scimitar)
Malakar +2							(Katana)
Warblade +4							(Two-handed Sword)
Battle Axe of Mauletar +2			(Battle axe)
Suryris's Blade +2					(Halberd)
Martial Staff +3					(Quarterstaff)
Cleric's Staff +3					(Quarterstaff)
Staff of Rhynn +4					(Quarterstaff)
Necaradan's Crossbow +3				(Light crossbow)
Giant Hair Crossbow +3				(Heavy crossbow)
Dead Shot +2						(Longbow)
Elven Court Bow +3					(Longbow)
Arla's Dragonbane +3				(Sling)

There are two optional components to install:
- Kuroisai also appears in Amkethran:
Kuroisai manages to escape Saradush and reappears in Amkethran. This makes it REALLY easy to acquire certain +6 items.
- Kuroisai also appears at the Nashkel Carnival:
Only in the case of an EET installation.
If you install this component, merging objects as well as helping you in BG1 can help you reach +6 in TOB if you manage to import your creations. A good module for this is EET Tweaks, which has an option to import all group objects from SOD(BG1) into SOA.
Another tip is to install the "Talanthyr Item upgrade" mod, which offers a formula for converting two +1 protection rings into one +2. This makes it easier to target the +6 ring.
- Recipes cost less but require rare gems:
Recipes now only cost double the desired + x 1000 (6000 gp for a +3)(1000 gp for bracers of Defense AC 7/6, 2000 gp for bracers of Defense AC 5, then 4K, 6K, etc) but require a gem:
an emerald for +2, a diamond for +3, a star sapphire for +4, a king's tear for +5 and a rogue stone for +6. (a black opal for bracers of Defense AC 7/6/5) 
If you install this component, installing the Mersetek mods together can help you enormously.
- A +1 copy of each object in SOA:
Each combinable item has an extra +1 copy in the game. They are all placed in the stock of various shops. Exception: no +1 club, as the formulas only start with the +3 club from TOB. Installing this component also restores a fully coded but unused original BG2 pnj.


This module includes Rogue Rebalancing composites short bows, and a personal note: these bows are a real cheat, and Rogue Rebalancing offers enough to buy to make at least one +5 composite shortbow.


This modules includes also these Wares of the Planes items:
Bone Dagger +1						(Dagger)
Green Steel Dagger +1				(Dagger)
Enchanted Battle Axe +1				(Battle axe)
Ring of the Traveler (+1)			(Ring)
Mages Guard (AC 6)					(Bracers)
Magus Shield (AC 4)					(Bracers)
