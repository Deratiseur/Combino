Kurosai is a BG2EE npc who, for a lot of gp, can combine three +x items into one +x+1 item. This works for almost all '+x' items, from weapons to armour to jewellery. It can also combine bracers of Defense.
He can combine items up to +6 (AC 0 for the bracers of Defense) and the price asked is always "+ desired squared times a thousand": for example, to obtain a +4 shield, he asks for three +3 shields and 16,000 gp (4²x1000).(2K gp for bracers of Defense AC 7/6/5, then 4K, 9K, etc....)
He appears in Trademeet after the Daos have left. Later in the game he will move to Saradush, and disappear with the destruction of the town.


There are some items that kurosai doesn't include in its possibilities because there are so few instances of them in the game that you'll never be able to accumulate enough: wakizashi, ninjatõ, hide armour, splint mail.

There are four optional components to install:
- Kuroisai also appears in Amkethran:
Kuroisai manages to escape Saradush and reappears in Amkethran. This makes it REALLY easy to acquire certain +6 items.
- Kuroisai also appears at the Nashkel Carnival:
Only in the case of an EET installation.
If you install this component, merging objects as well as helping you in BG1 can help you reach +6 in TOB if you manage to import your creations. A good module for this is EET Tweaks, which has an option to import all group objects from SOD(BG1) into SOA.
Another tip is to install the "Talanthyr Item upgrade" mod, which offers a formula for converting two +1 protection rings into one +2. This makes it easier to target the +6 ring.
- Recipes cost less but require rare gems:
Recipes now only cost the desired + x2000 (6000 gp for a +3)(1000 gp for bracers of Defense AC 7/6, 2000 gp for bracers of Defense AC 5, then 4K, 6K, etc) but require a gem:
	- an emerald for +2
	- a diamond for +3
	- a star sapphire for +4
	- a king's tear for +5
	- a rogue stone for +6
	- a black opal for bracers of Defense AC 7/6/5. 
If you install this component, installing the Mersetek mod together can help you enormously.
- A +1 copy of each object in SOA:
Each combinable item has an extra +1 copy in the game. They are all placed in the stock of various shops. Exception: no +1 club, as the formulas only start with the +3 club from TOB. Installing this component also restores a fully coded but unused original BG2 pnj.



Version history :
v1: First release online
v2: Added the option "Recipes cost less but require rare gems:" proposed by Mornagest
	Added the option "Kuroisai also appears in Amkethran" after several suggestions concerning TOB on the forum.
v3: Items are no longer patched, instead they are copied (to avoid bugs if combined with other mods that modify items beforehand)
	Fixed incorrect formula Dagger +1 with Dagger of <CHARNAME>.
	Added management of Bracers of Defense.
	Added support for items from the "Wares of the planes" mod (21 new formulas).
	Added the option "A +1 copy of each object in SOA".
	Added the option "Kuroisaï also appears at the Nashkel Festival".
V4: Item names were taken from oBG2 whereas the mod is for BG2EE -> All names corrected.
	Kurosaï had nothing to say at the Nashkel Festival. (removal of the messy re-encounter dialog).
	If the "recipes require gems" option was installed, Kurosaï's presentation dialog remained the normal dialog.
v5: Added support for items included in more than a dozen mods.
	Personal items of pnjs added.
	Recalculation of recipes for +3 staffs, as there are several Cleric's Staff +3 and Martial Staff +3 staffs available, whereas recipes only calculate one of each.
	Consideration of a +3 sword dropped in the Watcher's Keep, which looks like a +3 longsword but has a unique reference.
	Total: 39x2 new recipes.
v5.1: Bug fixes reported by Loupgris, Selphira and Rivvers and corrected by Seplhira. Thanks to them :)
v5.2: If the "Recipes require gems" option was installed, Kurosai had nothing to say.
